        <h3><strong>What is gravity?</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things
          with mass or energy, including planets, stars, galaxies and even light, are attracted to (or
          gravitate toward) one another. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's
          gravity causes the tides of the oceans. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter
          present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing and forming stars and caused the stars to group
          together into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the
          Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.

                Gravity is caused by the mass of objects. The larger the mass, the more gravity it has. That's why
                the moon has less gravity than the Earth does. Its mass is less.

                There is gravity in space. There's gravity everywhere. When you see astronauts in space, it looks
                like they are floating. However, gravity is affecting them just like it's affecting us on Earth.

              <p>
                You can escape the atmosphere at any speed you want, but for us on Earth, there is a term called
                "escape velocity." This is the speed you would have to go to never come back to Earth. It's about
                seven miles a second, which is very, very fast.
